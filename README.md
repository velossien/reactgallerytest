## A simple image gallery powered by React.

### This is a work-in-progress.

This is a React powered test page I am using to learn more about Ruby on Rails apps. It was quickly bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), so I could focus on the Rails backend.  It includes a flex-box image gallery that is hooked up to an API-only Rails app ([here](https://github.com/velossien/railsgalleryapitest)) which allows me to use CRUD operations to create and post new images. Once I have all the CRUD operations up and running smoothly for this site, I will transfer my knowledge to [here](https://github.com/velossien/photo-gallery) and [here](https://github.com/velossien/FolejoDePuertoNuevo).
